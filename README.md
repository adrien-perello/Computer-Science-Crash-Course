## Option 2 (best but longer and require installation)

- Download the repository as a ZIP (or clone it)
- Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Option 3 (not interactive)

Copy the link of the specific notebook you are interested in [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

## Option 4 (not interactive and less nice)

Look at the notebook directly from github
